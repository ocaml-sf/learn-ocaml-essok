      You can use two ways to upload your files : Github way or local way.

      <br />

      In github way you just have to enter a correct Github URL of the
      repository you want to add to your server then click on the button.

      <app-expansion-img-panels [imgPanels]="[IMGPANELS.UPLOADFILES[1]]">
      </app-expansion-img-panels>

      In the local way, browse the files you want to add then select it.

      <app-expansion-img-panels [imgPanels]="[IMGPANELS.UPLOADFILES[2]]">
      </app-expansion-img-panels>

      The file must be an .zip archive and the exercises must be at the archive
      root.

      <app-expansion-img-panels [imgPanels]="[IMGPANELS.UPLOADFILES[3]]">
      </app-expansion-img-panels>

      Not in a subdirectory of the root.

      <app-expansion-img-panels [imgPanels]="[IMGPANELS.UPLOADFILES[4]]">
      </app-expansion-img-panels>

      Then you should have this screen.

      Click on upload then wait for the status response.

      <app-expansion-img-panels [imgPanels]="[IMGPANELS.UPLOADFILES[6]]">

      Otherwise may be you have a problem with your .zip archive.

      accepted, just try another archive software and submit again.
